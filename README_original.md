# z-waif
Fully local &amp; open source AI Waifu. VTube Studio, Discord, Minecraft, custom made RAG (long term memory), alarm, and plenty more! Has a WebUI and hotkey shortcuts. All software is free (or extremely cheap)!

Reccomended Windows 10/11 and a CUDA (NVidia) GPU with atleast 16GB+ of VRAM.
Can now support Mac and Linux! Thanks [@cootshk](https://github.com/cootshk)! Any brand (AMD, NVidia, Intel) GPU with 8GB+ VRAM bare mininum requirement.
Uses Oobabooga, RVC, and Whisper to run AI systems locally. Works as a front end to tie many programs together into one cohesive whole.

The goal of the project is less about giving an "all in one package", and moreso to give you the tools and knowledge for you to create your own AI Waifu!

## Diaspora
#### The Original:
[TumblerWarren/Virtual_Avatar_ChatBot](https://github.com/TumblerWarren/Virtual_Avatar_ChatBot), this is the original project that this code is spun-off of. Full credit to that project - it provided the skeleton for the many advancements now in place. It has more of a focus on non-local AI, if that is what you need.
#### Branches & Versions:
[Drakkadakka/z-waif-experimental-](https://github.com/Drakkadakka/z-waif-experimental-), offers a few upgrades; namely Twitch chat & streaming support, as well as a few other enhancements.


## Recent Changelog

v1.9-R3

- While using Ollama, all system messages are appeneded as if they are the "Character Card", meaning they are more condensed in memory. Includes:
	- Current Time
	- Lorebook Additions
	- Current Task
	- RAG Memory

- Can now define a different model for visual use while using Ollama.

- RP Suppression starts off by default now.
- Max Tokens default is now 300.

- RAG prefers slightly more focused / shorter messages when picking from different options.

- Re-added standard configs and random temps to Ollama.
- "TOKEN_LIMIT" (aka context length) also works in Ollama now, and is no longer stuck to 2048.
	- This makes it only somewhat faster while loading memory than Oobabooga, keep in mind.
- Non-streamed image API now replies as if they are the waifu and not a "visual assistant".
- Fixed errors being made due to the Oobabooga streaming image API going to the wrong port after the recent update.

---.---.---.---

v1.9-R2

- Fixed the .env file not being updated, crashing the whole program. GitHub likes to ignore that file and I forgot to check. Whoops!

---.---.---.---

v1.9

- Ollama Support!
	- Thanks to @cootshk and myself!
	- Properly functioning visual models!
	- No need to load models manually after booting - it happens automatically.
	- Memory is cached, meaning instant replies and ability to jack up the max memory w/o much penalty.
	- Less control at the moment - beware! Max Tokens, Stopping Strings, and other model control features are non-functional.
		- This is a priority to tinker with and fix.
		- Also due to models having their settings (temperature, rep_penalty, ect.) baked into themselves.
	- Tutorials will be out after I properly update it in a week or two.

- Images can be sent at different sizes using "IMG_SCALE" in the .env.
- API port for Oobabooga / other Open-AI typed endpoints can now be configured in the .env.
- Tasks can now be set in configurables, although there is no way for the AI to access them right now.

- Removed classic transcription being hardcoded to English only.
- Renamed "utils.logging" to "utils.zw_logging" so that it's not overlapping a base library.
- Renamed "API.Oogabooga_API_Support" to "API.api_controller", as it is the generic now.

## State of Development

The project could be considered in an "early access state". Some parts may be mildly buggy, janky, or obtuse. The project as a whole, however, is stable and reasonably effective.

The goal of the project is pretty simple; make AI waifus. The extents of this project are intended to stay within the bounds of helping people create a singular, locally hosted AI waifu, who's partnership can benefit both you and them. In short, symbiosis.
